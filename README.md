1st round random pairings

The basic principles of a Swiss System tournament are:

* The number of rounds to be played is declared beforehand.

* Two players may play each other only once.

* Players are paired with others of the same score, or nearest score.

* When possible, a player is given the white pieces as many times as he is given the black pieces.

* When possible, a player is given the colour other than that he was given the previous round.

* The final ranking order is determined by the aggregate of points won: 1 point for a win, 0.5 point for a draw and 0 point for a loss. A player whose opponent fails to appear for a scheduled game receives one point
